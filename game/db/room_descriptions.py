#outside description

The air is still has the memory of winter about it. The late spring eve 
is framed by the orangey glow of the sun sinking into the horizon. The air 
is thick and pungent with the smoke of many peat fires from all the inns
along south london road. The road is cobble stone. The cobbles are slick with 
the muck of the many horses and pack mules that past this way bound for 
Canterbury.    


#Inn exterior description"
print """
The Tabard stands before you. It's marked by its swinging sign board,
gaudily done in the Abbot of Hyde's colors. The greatest of the 
great inns all shoved up on each other along South London road. It
dwarves its smalller competitors like the Bull and Feather. It's 
Southwark's finest inn as all know it. Tonight it's full to bursting 
with pilgrims bound Canterbury way. The mud and daub structure with 
exposed timbers stands regally and beckons entry to all who pass by.

#inn interior description

The inn is brightly and lively on this summer's eve. The rich timbre of 
drunken song and clink of earth-waren tankards rebound off the walls. 
The peppery smell of many unwashed bodies, and clean horse sweat pervade the
air.

#inn hearth description

The hearth is wide and open, and dominates the center of the inn's
central hall. It's broad stone flagons are old and crackled with many a
happy fire. Pilgrims from all walks of London town life perch on its wide
berth. The fire is banked low and the rich scent of beeve drippings fill the
the with their smoky goodness. 

# bar description

print """
The bar is a long oaken trestle that stretches along the back of the inn
proper. There are a few stools. Perched on one of them, is scholarly fellow
with an impish grin, and a merry twinkle in his eye. He's strategically
positioned himself near the taps.

# chaucer description
His cheeks are ruddy with more than few tankards of good english 
ale. He's a tale spinner for sure. In front of him are an ink pot,
sharp quills at the ready and a large phampilset of foolscrap 
already densely scribbled with his beautiful long hand.
