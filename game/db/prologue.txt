WHEN that April is, with his showers sweet,                       
The drought of March hath pierced to the root,
And bathed every vein in such liquor,
Of which virtue engender'd is the flower;
When Zephyrus eke with his sweet breath
Inspired hath in every holt* and heath                    
The tender croppes* and the younge sun                    
Hath in the Ram his halfe course y-run,
And smalle fowles make melody,
That sleepen all the night with open eye,
So pricketh them nature in their corages;       
Then longe folk to go on pilgrimages,
And palmers for to seeke strange strands,
To distant saints known in sundry lands;     
And specially, from every shire's end
Of Engleland, to Canterbury they wend,
The holy blissful Martyr for to seek,
That them hath helped, when that they were sick.               

Befell that, in that season on a day,
In Southwark at the Tabard as I lay,
Ready to wenden on my pilgrimage
To Canterbury with devout corage,
At night was come into that hostelry
Well nine and twenty in a company
Of sundry folk, by aventure y-fall            
In fellowship, and pilgrims were they all,           
That toward Canterbury woulde ride.
The chamber, and the stables were wide,
And well we weren eased at the best.           
And shortly, when the sunne was to rest,                  
So had I spoken with them every one,
That I was of their fellowship anon,
And made forword early for to rise,                            
To take our way there to you as I describe.
